The host venue for the Tag Football Asia Cup 2026 has been confirmed as J-GREEN Sakai in Sakai City, Osaka, Japan.
This event is an international tournament where representative teams from across Asia will compete in fast-paced, highly tactical matches.
In addition, we will run a Beginner Try-Out Session (for kids and adults) so that more people—regardless of experience—can enjoy and experience Tag Football (8-a-side Tag Rugby).
 
## Confirmed Event Dates
• Saturday 11 April & Sunday 12 April 2026 (2-day event)
• Venue: J-GREEN Sakai (Sakai City, Osaka)
• Field: S-14 (confirmed)
 
## Beginner Try-Out Session (Kids / Adults)
For anyone who would like to try Tag Football (8-a-side Tag Rugby) for the first time, we will hold an introductory session covering the basic rules and safe play.
After the introduction, participants will be divided into teams and play a friendly match, making it easy and enjoyable to learn through gameplay.
The Beginner Try-Out Session will be held on the morning of Saturday 11 April.
We will also run a referee clinic, led by a Referee Development Coach invited from Australia.
 
## Asia Cup Competition Divisions (6 Divisions)
The Asia Cup will be held across the following six divisions (subject to change):
• Men’s Open
• Women’s Open
• Mixed Open
• Men’s Over 30
• Men’s Masters
• Mixed Seniors
 
With categories ranging from open divisions to age-based divisions, Tag Football is attracting attention as a true “sport for life”—enjoyed by people of all ages and abilities.
Because the game uses tagging instead of tackling, there is minimal contact, making it both safe and competitive.
The sport is also highly tactical, featuring kicking options such as the grubber kick, which adds variety and excitement to the game.
In Australia—one of the sport’s founding countries—more than 200,000 people play Tag Football, and it is now enjoyed in over 30 countries worldwide, making it a globally recognized sport.
 
 
## About the Mixed Division
In the Mixed division, teams must have at least four female players on the field.
To encourage and reward women’s involvement, tries scored by female players receive a +1 bonus point.
This creates a dynamic, strategic style of play where all players can make a meaningful impact.
Note: Detailed rules for the Mixed division will be officially released in the tournament regulations.
 
## Participating Countries (Current)
